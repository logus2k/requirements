"""Set-level INCOSE analysis (characteristics C10–C15).

These assess the requirement SET as a whole by relating requirements to each
other, which the per-requirement judges never do. Two parts:

  1. find_overlaps() — concrete, reranker-based near-duplicate/overlap detection
     across the set (hard evidence for C11 Consistent). Reuses the reranker that
     cleanly separates true overlap (~0.95) from mere topical similarity (<0.05).
  2. assess_set() — a holistic LLM set-judge that rates C10–C15 from a set
     summary plus the detected overlaps, with justifications and findings.

The overlaps are grounded evidence; the set-judge is a holistic opinion informed
by that evidence and a representative sample.
