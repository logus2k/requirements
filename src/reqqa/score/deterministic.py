"""Deterministic INCOSE rule detectors.

The 15 rules the GtWR expresses as explicit term/symbol lists are detected here
exactly — no LLM. Each finding cites the offending token and its offset, so it is
auditable and never hallucinated (the R21-miss the LLM made). The term lists live
in incose/catalog.json (detector == "deterministic").

These are HIGH-RECALL detectors: some rules (R19 "and"/"or", R5 "a") fire very
often by design. Presence is a signal; severity/context is decided by the
characteristic judge that consumes these findings.
