"""Single-requirement assessment — the interactive-editor path.

Unlike `scripts/produce_scorecard.py` (a batch driver over a whole document),
this scores ONE requirement statement the user is typing. No ingest, no
segmentation, no set-level (all of which need a document / the whole set).

Two tiers, matching the editor UX:
  - deterministic findings — pure regex, sub-millisecond, safe to run on every
    keystroke (`reqqa.score.deterministic.check_requirement`).
  - LLM tier — the 9 C1–C9 judges (batch=1) + the Reviewer for rewrite
    suggestions. Local-LLM bound (~4s for all 9 warm), so the editor runs this
    on a debounce, not per keystroke.

`assess_requirement` returns the full result in one shot. `iter_assessment`
yields the same information incrementally (deterministic first, then one event
per judge as it returns, then the review) so the editor can stream results —
the single GPU serializes the judges anyway, so first-score-in-~0.5s beats
waiting ~4s for a parallel batch.
