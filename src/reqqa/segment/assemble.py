"""Cross-block reassembly by requirement ID (spec: Groups A/B/C fix).

A single requirement is often scattered across blocks that share one author ID:
a table row gives the label ("QR7 System Availability"), a separate Planguage
block gives the measurable target ("MUST: More than 98% of the time"). Neither
piece is a complete requirement alone, so the gate drops both.

This step groups identified requirements by their author ID — taken from the
req_id (table rows) or from the "ID: <X>" heading Docling captured in the
section_path — and, for any ID with more than one piece, asks the assembler role
to compose ONE requirement from the pieces' own words. Grounding is enforced by
near-match against the UNION of the piece texts; if the assembly can't be
grounded, the pieces are kept separate (never invent).

Grouping by a structural ID label is association, not lexical requirement
identification — the LLM still owns "is this a requirement".
