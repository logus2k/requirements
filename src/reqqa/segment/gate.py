"""The approval gate: identify → judge → (drop | accept | refine-loop).

The Judge is an approval gate; it never writes requirements. Per requirement:
  - requirement      → ACCEPTED
  - not_requirement  → DROPPED immediately (retained + justification, for audit)
  - uncertain        → sent back to the Refiner, which either isolates the real
                       requirement (staying grounded to source) or drops it; then
                       the Judge re-gates. Bounded at `max_iters` rounds; still
                       uncertain after that → ESCALATE_TO_HUMAN.

Membership only — INCOSE quality is a separate workflow step. Refined text is
validated against the source (near-match); a refinement that can't be grounded
escalates rather than being trusted (no invention).
