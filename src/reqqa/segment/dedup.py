"""Overview-dedup: fold terse summary bullets into their detailed requirement.

An SRS often states a capability twice - once as a terse bullet in an overview/
scope section ("Job creation and publishing") and once as a detailed requirement
("The system SHALL allow employers to create and publish job postings."). Both
are extracted; the summary double-counts.

We detect the redundancy with the RERANKER (not cosine - cosine can't separate a
summary from a merely-related requirement in an SRS; the reranker scores true
subsumption ~0.95 vs <0.05). Each summary-candidate is reranked against the
detailed pool; if its best match clears the threshold, it is MARKED
`duplicate_of` that detailed requirement (retained for audit, excluded from the
primary set). Marking never deletes, and a candidate with no strong match stays a
primary - so a capability stated only in an overview keeps its requirement.
