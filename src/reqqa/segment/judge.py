"""Precision judge (adversarial second opinion) over identified requirements.

Same model, different role. For each candidate requirement the judge returns a
three-way verdict — requirement / not_requirement / uncertain — plus a short
justification. "uncertain" is a first-class outcome: genuinely borderline items
(e.g. use-case scenario steps) are surfaced as borderline, not forced.

This measures PRECISION (false positives among the extracted set). Recall (what
was missed) is a separate analysis — it needs a pass over the full source, not
over the extracted set.
